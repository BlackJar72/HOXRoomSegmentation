# HOX Room Segmentation

This is an experiment in procedurally generating complex, organized, and (hopefully) believable rooms (and perhaps 
other structures) inspireed by the body plan organization of bilaterian animals and the HOX genes which influence 
the overall plan.

Currently this is in very early development.  Step one is to create a system that will build such structures from 
supplied prefabs and related data.  Once that is working well step two will be to fill in the details from more 
general templates allowing variations or even entirely new types if done right.

It is not expected to be good for all types of rooms and areas, but hopefully be good for a wide ranges of them. 
For insight into the idea, think of a trilobite and a church sanctuary, and how on a certain deep level they are 
structured similarly: A head region (with either eyes and mouth, or a pulpit and altar), a series of small segments 
(with either legs or pews), and a tail area (with not much going one).  Now think of a barracks with rows of beds. 
Turn off symmetry, and immagine with bathroom stalls or bowling lanes.  The possibiliies are endless, though, 
admittedly, far from all incompasing.
